# ML-AND-DEEP-LEARNING-FOR-PSR-REGION
 This project applies Machine Learning and Deep Learning to analyze images of the Moon's Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR). It detects craters and boulders using ML algorithms and enhances image quality with deep learning, improving visibility of geological features in shadowed areas for better lunar exploration insights.
