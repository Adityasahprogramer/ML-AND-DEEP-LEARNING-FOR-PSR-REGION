ML and Deep Learning for PSR Region Image Analysis
This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to analyze images from the Moon's Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR). The primary objectives of the project are to detect lunar geological features (craters and boulders) and enhance image quality to improve the visibility of features in shadowed areas.

Key Features
Crater and Boulder Detection: Uses ML algorithms to automatically identify and classify craters and boulders in PSR images.
Image Enhancement: Implements deep learning models to enhance the quality of PSR region images, making geological features more visible in low-light conditions.
